# AffineInterpolation

1. Run the file InteractiveAffineInterpolation.m
2. Provide the translation part of the affine transformation.
3. Provide the linear part of the affine transformation.
4. Select a object on which you want to see the results of interpolation.
5. Provide a timesteps for which interpolation is to be computed.


Sample code:

1. Enter 3x1 translation part of the Affine transformation. 
[4 4 4]

2. Enter 3x3 Linear part of the Affine transformation.
[0.5000   -0.8660         0 ;
 0.8660    0.5000         0 ;
      0         0    1.0000];

3. Enter 1 for tetrahedron and 2 for cube.
1

4. Enter the time step for the interpolation like [.25 .3 .8] or 0:.1:1 
0:.2:1
